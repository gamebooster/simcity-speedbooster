## Usage

Start SimCity, load your city then start the program. Then set your desired speed.

* Turtle: 0.25
* Llama:  1.00
* Cheetah: 2.00

You can go up to 5.00 without any gameplay trouble (safe value different from city to city). From there some agents (water, sewage etc) seem to have problems.
